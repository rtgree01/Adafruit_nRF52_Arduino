# Arduino Core for Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Boards

## This fork of the Arduino Core adds ANT+ functionality
- There are a few prerequisites:
1. Obtain the softdevice from [thisisant.com](https://www.thisisant.com)
2. Rebuild the bootloader. See helpful info [here](http://orrmany.hu/wiki/doku.php?id=s340_softdevice_adafruit_nrf52840_feather_express)
3. Create a project in PlatformIO. Specify this option in the platformio.ini file: 
```
platform_packages = framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52 @ https://github.com/rtgree01/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino.git#add_ant
```
4. Copy the bootloader .hex and .zip files to the newly created directory in your system's default platformio/packages/framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52@src-9ea59e5b56320711578bf5d0161bf395/bootloader/feather_nrf52840_express/ directory
5. Copy the API files into your system's default platformio/packages/framework-arduinoadafruitnrf52@src-9ea59e5b56320711578bf5d0161bf395/cores/nRF5/nordic/softdevice/s340_nrf52_6.1.1_API/
6. Build your project.

## BSP Installation

There are two methods that you can use to install this BSP. We highly recommend the first option unless you wish to participate in active development of this codebase via Github.

### Recommended: Adafruit nRF52 BSP via the Arduino Board Manager

 1. [Download and install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (At least v1.6.12)
 2. Start the Arduino IDE
 3. Go into Preferences
 4. Add https://www.adafruit.com/package_adafruit_index.json as an 'Additional Board Manager URL'
 5. Restart the Arduino IDE
 6. Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install 'Adafruit nRF52 by Adafruit'
 7. Once the BSP is installed, select 'Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Feather' from the Tools -> Board menu, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52.

### Optional (Core Development): Adafruit nRF52 BSP via git

 1. Install BSP via Board Manager as above to install compiler & tools.
 2. Delete the core folder `nrf52` installed by Board Manager in Adruino15, depending on your OS. It could be
  * macOS  : `~/Library/Arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52`
  * Linux  : `~/.arduino15/packages/adafruit/hardware/nrf52`
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Local\Arduino15\packages\adafruit\hardware\nrf52`
 3. `cd <SKETCHBOOK>`, where `<SKETCHBOOK>` is your Arduino Sketch folder:
  * macOS  : `~/Documents/Arduino`
  * Linux  : `~/Arduino`
  * Windows: `~/Documents/Arduino`
 4. Create a folder named `hardware/Adafruit`, if it does not exist, and change directories to it
 5. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino.git`
 6. Restart the Arduino IDE
 7. Once the BSP is installed, select 'Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 Feather' from the Tools -> Board menu, which will update your system config to use the right compiler and settings for the nRF52.

### Adafruit's nrfutil tools

[adafruit-nrfutil](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_nrfutil) (derived from Nordic pc-nrfutil) is needed to upload sketch via serial port.

- For Windows and macOS, pre-built executable binaries are included in the BSP at `tools/adafruit-nrfutil/`. It should work out of the box.
- Linux user need to run follow command to install it from PyPi

    ```
    $ pip3 install adafruit-nrfutil --user
	```

### Drivers

- [SiLabs CP2104 driver](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/pages/usbtouartbridgevcpdrivers.aspx) is required for USB to Serial when using with Feather nRF52832

## Bootloader Support

### Upgrade existing Bootloader

Bluefruit's Bootloader is self-upgradable, you could upgrade to the latest Bootloader + Softdevice using the serial port within Arduino IDE.

- Select `Tools > Board > Adafruit Bluefruit Feather52`
- Select `Tools > Programmer > Bootloader DFU for Bluefruit nRF52`
- Select `Tools > Burn Bootloader`
- **WAIT** until the process complete ~30 seconds

**Note: close the Serial Monitor before you click "Burn Bootloader". Afterwards, you shouldn't close the Arduino IDE, unplug the Feather, launch Serial Monitor etc ... to abort the process. There is a high chance it will brick your device! Do this with care and caution.**

### Burning new Bootloader

To burn the bootloader from within the Arduino IDE, you will need the following tools installed
on your system and available in the system path:

- Segger [JLink Software and Documentation Pack](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink)
- Nordic [nRF5x Command Line Tools](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_installation.html)

Check to make sure you can run `nrfjprog` from your terminal/command prompt

**macOS Note** At present, you will need to create a symlink in `/usr/local/bin` to the
`nrfjprog` tool wherever you have added it. You can run the following command, for example:

```
$ ln -s $HOME/prog/nordic/nrfjprog/nrfjprog /usr/local/bin/nrfjprog
```

Once the tools above have been installed and added to your system path, from the Arduino IDE:

- Select `Tools > Board > Adafruit Bluefruit Feather52`
- Select `Tools > Programmer > J-Link for Feather52`
- Select `Tools > Burn Bootloader` with the board and J-Link connected

If you wish to modify bootloader to your own need, check out its repo here [Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader)

#### Manually Burning the Bootloader via nrfjprog

The bootloader hex file can be found at `bin/bootloader` run the command as follows:

```
$ nrfjprog -e -f nrf52
$ nrfjprog --program feather_nrf52832_bootloader.hex -f nrf52
$ nrfjprog --reset -f nrf52
```

This core is based on [Arduino-nRF5](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5) by Sandeep Mistry,
which in turn is based on the [Arduino SAMD Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd).

The following libraries are used:

- adafruit-nrfutil is based on Nordic Semiconductor ASA's [pc-nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil)
- [freeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/) as operating system
- [tinyusb](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) as usb stack
- [nrfx](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx) for peripherals driver
- [littlefs](https://github.com/ARMmbed/littlefs) for internal file system
